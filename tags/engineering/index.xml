The one-on-ones. The feedback. The “oh god I have so many vacation requests to approve.”</p>
<p>But once you get through that? The game changes. You realize pretty quickly that <strong>you can’t get anything meaningful done by just managing the folks who report to you.</strong></p>
<p>Your team doesn’t own all the code paths. Product has their own priorities. Design has their own calendar. Your boss has opinions. Two different executive stakeholders both want to own your team&rsquo;s roadmap for the next quarter with conflicting demands. Suddenly everything&rsquo;s on fire, the streams are crossing, you can&rsquo;t control <em>any</em> of it, and the idea of letting it all burn to the ground while you go flip burgers at Wendy&rsquo;s seems pretty damn tempting.</p>
<p>Welcome to the part of management nobody warned you about: learning how to influence without authority.</p>
<p>And here’s the truth: every Engineering Manager job interview you’ll ever do will come back to this. It’s one of those “tell me about a time…” questions that separates the rookies from the people who can actually move an org forward.</p>

<h2 id="why-your-title-doesnt-mean-shit">Why Your Title Doesn’t Mean Shit</h2>
<p>This was a tough lesson for me to learn early on in my career: having “manager” in your title doesn’t magically grant you superpowers. People outside your team don’t care about your reporting line. They care about <em>their</em> goals, their deadlines, their pain. If you come in swinging your title around, at <em>best</em> you&rsquo;ll actually get nothing accomplished. At <em>worst</em> you&rsquo;ll start to make <strong>enemies.</strong></p>
<p>I can tell you from stark, painful personal experience how hard that is to recover from.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tools-i-wish-id-figured-out-earlier">Tools I Wish I’d Figured Out Earlier</h2>
<p>The first tool is <strong>relationships.</strong> People help people they like and trust, and there’s no shortcut for that. If you only show up when you need something, you won’t get far. You start building this on Management Day #1 (or today!). If you haven’t been working on building trust with your cross-functional partners and positioning yourself as a voice of reason and clarity in the room <em>before</em> shit hits the fan (and it will), you’re going to be in a tough spot.</p>
<p>The second is <strong>framing.</strong> Your idea has to live in other people’s worlds, not just yours. Don’t pitch a logging standard; pitch cutting support tickets in half. Don’t talk about “technical debt”; talk about freeing up capacity for roadmap features. Selling an idea or persuading someone to see your point of view is a hell of a lot more effective when you can position it as something that aligns with their best interests. &ldquo;Help me help you&rdquo; will get you a lot farther than &ldquo;do it my way&rdquo; ever could.</p>
<p>Third, you need to <strong>tell the story.</strong> Humans don’t rally around bullet points and Jira tickets, they rally around a clear <em>why</em>. Nothing will erode your authority faster than coming across like you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about, so make the fuck sure that you do. Paint a picture that people want to be part of. Keep the receipts. Show your work. Present the data supporting your point of view. Make it crystal-clear why the thing is the <em>right</em> thing. And honestly? If you can&rsquo;t conclusively bring this to the table then maybe what you want to do isn&rsquo;t the right idea after all. There&rsquo;s no shame in realizing that.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>repetition</strong> matters more than you think. You’ll feel like a broken record long before anyone else has actually absorbed your message. If it’s important, keep saying it until people start repeating it back to you. If you&rsquo;re starting to feel sick of saying the same thing over and over again that just might mean you&rsquo;re on the right track.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-i-fucked-this-up-a-sob-story">How I Fucked This Up: A Sob Story</h2>
<p>I hate to shatter the perfect angelic image I’ve so carefully cultivated, but I learned all this the hard way.</p>
<center><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZ2JjeGtlOWhjeDc3N24xd2FiYW1kZnpxajFkY2VmYW16OG0xb2MweSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/yRqZr5CsHGQxxPXqFC/giphy.gif" alt="Look, if you can't see what this gif is displaying you're probably actually better off." width="300"></center>
<p>Years ago, in a different life and a different industry, I ran all internal and external communications for a megachurch. Church website, print materials, event promotion, radio ads, press releases, the whole noodle. I was young, headstrong, and thought that because I was the DRI for these things, I had the final say in how everything operated and everyone would automatically follow my lead. Shut up, stop laughing.</p>
<p>This all fell apart in spectacular fashion the very first time the music director and the missionary pastor both wanted prime real estate on the church website at the same time. It crumbled further when six different staff members had opinions about a font choice I had used for a Christmas Eve service program. It turned into a smoldering crater when I figured I could just make decisions in a vacuum because I was ✨Responsible✨ only to find angry mobs lined up outside my office demanding their individual pounds of flesh.</p>
<p>In the end, I failed not because I lacked the skills to produce the work. I failed because I hadn&rsquo;t cultivated a single one of the tools mentioned above. I hadn&rsquo;t built relationships, I didn&rsquo;t take the time to learn or assess other people’s wants or needs, I had no idea how to reframe competing options around the organization’s overall goals, and I assumed saying things once was enough. Remember how I said earlier that making enemies is hard to recover from? The only thing I did right in this situation was quit before they could fire me.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-practice-without-burning-yourself-out">How to Practice Without Burning Yourself Out</h2>
<p>You don’t learn influence by reading about it, you learn it by trying. But trying doesn’t mean pushing every single idea uphill until you’re exhausted. Pick your spots. Start with something small where the stakes are low and you can afford to stumble, like a process tweak or a quality-of-life improvement for your team. Treat each attempt like a rep at the gym: you’re building muscle, not chasing a personal best every time. And when something doesn’t land, don’t take it as a referendum on your leadership. Take the feedback, adjust, and go again. Influence is a long game, and the only way to get better at it is to practice in ways that won’t leave you bitter or burned out.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-every-interviewer-will-ask-you-about-this">Why Every Interviewer Will Ask You About This</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever prepped for a management interview, you know the question is coming: <em>“Tell me about a time you influenced without authority.”</em> It shows up in every loop because it is the quickest way to gauge whether you can operate beyond the walls of your own team. Influence without authority is really about <strong>scope</strong>. As an engineering manager, your job is not just to make your team successful, it is to move initiatives forward across teams, disciplines, and sometimes even the entire organization.</p>
<p>At some point, you&rsquo;ll need to convince Product to adjust priorities, persuade Design to tweak scope, get another engineering team to adopt standards, or rally leadership around a technical investment that doesn&rsquo;t have obvious short-term ROI. None of these come with direct authority. What you bring to the table is credibility, clarity, and the ability to create alignment where there was none.</p>
<p>This is exactly why interviewers care. Your ability to influence across boundaries is a proxy for whether you can manage scope at the next level. Scope is <em>messy</em>. It lives in the Venn Diagram overlap between teams. Your engineering team&rsquo;s performance and impact might be dialled in, but if you can only operate at that level you&rsquo;ll eventually hit a ceiling. A manager who can influence across functions is someone an interviewer can imagine leading bigger programs, other managers, and shaping the organization itself.</p>
<center><img src="/influence-venn.png" style="border: 2px black solid" alt="Venn Diagram showing the overlap between Engineering, Product, and Design with the caption 'Surprise! You live in these spaces now.'"></center>
<center><small>Everything's better with a Venn.</small></center>
<hr>
<h2 id="dont-screw-this-up">Don&rsquo;t Screw This Up</h2>
<p>Influence without authority is uncomfortable because it forces you to play the long game. It takes time and energy to build trust in the people around you. You won’t get it right every time, and it’ll feel slower and messier than you want. But every conversation, every nudge, and every relationship you invest in builds leverage for the moments that matter. With practice, influence without authority is what takes you from being just a <strong>manager</strong> who keeps the trains running to a <strong>leader</strong> who can move the whole organization forward.</p>
<p>You don’t get influence by asking nicely. You get it by showing up, doing the work over and over, until no one can ignore you.</p>

Part 2: Performance Management</title><link>https://scottkosman.com/post/blog/so-youre-a-manager-now-performance-management/</link><guid>https://scottkosman.com/post/blog/so-youre-a-manager-now-performance-management/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><description>Struggling reports and quiet high performers both need your attention. Performance management isn’t just for problems.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After my last post <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44745123">made the rounds</a> (hi Hacker News, you spicy little firestorm), one topic came up a whole bunch in the comments: <strong>performance management</strong>. Specifically, how to handle the extremes: the folks who are struggling and the ones who are quietly crushing it. <em>(If you missed Part 1, “<a href="https://scottkosman.com/post/blog/so-youre-a-manager-now/">So You’re a Manager Now,</a>” that’s where this whole series started.)</em></p>
<p>So let’s talk about both. Because if you’re only focused on one end of the spectrum, you’re missing the point.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="managing-low-performers-its-not-about-being-nice">Managing Low Performers: It’s Not About Being “Nice”</h2>
<p>There’s a difference between being kind and being vague. Too many new managers mistake silence for mercy. “They’re trying hard. I don’t want to hurt their feelings.” So they say nothing until review season rolls around and suddenly it’s a “surprise” that someone’s underperforming.</p>
<p>That’s not kindness. That’s negligence.</p>
<p>Effective performance management starts with clarity. Don’t wait for an official review to start giving feedback. An annual review is the <em>worst</em> possible time to surprise someone. If you see a pattern, speak up early, and do it with honesty and care. If you&rsquo;re a manager who truly cares about your people, there are few worse experiences imaginable than blindsiding someone with hard feedback they didn&rsquo;t see coming. I&rsquo;ve been on both ends of that conversation and trust me, <strong>nobody</strong> wins in that situation.</p>
<p>Avoid vague feedback like “work harder” or “work faster.” That kind of direction only creates confusion and frustration. Instead, be specific. If someone isn’t writing tests, routinely underestimates their work, or leaves PRs sitting unreviewed for days, say so clearly. And if your organization has a career framework or a set of expectations for their level, use it. Point to exactly where they’re falling short so they can see the gap for themselves and start closing it.</p>
<center><img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExemY1Z2U5ZTJzdXFtdnE4M2VkYTA1NXNybHVybXVicnZnc3NqdWR6aCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/l2JeijAxh77OfNY6Q/giphy.gif" alt="NO GIGGLING"></center>
<center><small>It's important to set expectations clearly.</small></center><br>
<p>Don’t rely on “vibes” to figure out if someone’s improving. Set measurable, trackable, and achievable goals. Maybe it’s completing 90 percent of their committed sprint work, closing a specific number of story points, reducing escaped bugs, or writing cleaner PRs that don’t need major rewrites. Whatever the goals are, define them clearly, agree on them together, and track progress over time. Make the target visible so both of you know whether it’s being hit.</p>
<p>If someone’s falling short, give them a fair, <strong>timeboxed</strong>  chance to turn things around. That means coaching, regular check-ins, and real support, not just sitting back and hoping for the best. The timebox matters. Your report needs to know exactly how long they have to show improvement, whether that’s 60 days, 90 days, or something else, and what success actually looks like. And if things still don’t improve by the end of that window, you have to be ready to act. It’s not easy, but keeping someone in a role they can’t succeed in doesn’t help them, the team, or you.</p>
<p>You can be honest without being harsh. You can be firm and still compassionate. And you <em>should</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="managing-high-performers-dont-just-let-them-drift">Managing High Performers: Don’t Just Let Them Drift</h2>
<p>High performers often get the opposite treatment. They’re doing fine, so you leave them alone. No complaints, no drama, just smooth sailing. What’s not to love?</p>
<p>The problem is, if you don’t invest in your top performers, you risk losing them. They may not need hand-holding, but they <em>do</em> need to feel seen, challenged, and valued. Turns out “no news is good news” isn’t a great retention strategy.</p>
<p>Start with visibility. Make sure their contributions are noticed, not just by you, but by your peers and leadership. Give them stretch assignments that push them to grow: let them lead projects, mentor others, or explore technical direction. Recognize their work in a way that actually lands. This doesn’t mean praise for praise’s sake, but a clear signal that their effort and impact matter.</p>
<p>No matter how much code someone’s shipping, there’s <em>always</em> room to grow. It’s your job to help them spot those growth areas, especially the ones they can’t see. People can be brutal self-critics, sure, but we’re also great at missing our own blind spots. Maybe they smash at writing code, but can’t explain it to a non-technical stakeholder without everyone’s eyes glazing over. Maybe they’re great at executing but have never been pulled in early to help define the work. Could they run a demo? Present to an exec? Mentor that struggling engineer we talked about earlier? Growth isn’t just “do more,” it’s <em>“make more impact”</em> and you’re the one who helps them figure out how.</p>
<p>And for the love of pants talk to them about what’s next. What does that high-performing Senior Developer want to grow into? Are they leaning toward a Staff or Architect path? Curious about management? Totally unsure and hoping someone will help them figure it out? News flash: <strong>that someone is you</strong>. It’s your job to start that conversation, poke at the possibilities, and help them sketch out what’s ahead. If they’re already thinking about their next move and you haven’t asked, don’t be shocked when they ghost you for the LinkedIn recruiter who did.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="side-note-if-youre-new-to-this-get-a-guide">Side Note: If You’re New to This, Get a Guide</h2>
<center><img src="/dangerous.jpg" alt="it's dangerous to go alone! take this." width="300"></center>
<p>Performance management is hard. It takes judgment, clarity, and a willingness to have uncomfortable conversations. If you&rsquo;re new to this, you&rsquo;re probably second-guessing yourself a lot. That&rsquo;s expected, this shit is <em>not</em> easy and you shouldn&rsquo;t go it alone.</p>
<p>Find a mentor. Someone who’s been through it before. Someone who can gut-check your instincts, help you calibrate expectations, sanity-check your documentation, and give you honest feedback on how you’re showing up. This could be a more seasoned colleague, a former manager from your last gig, or even a stranger on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringManagers/">r/EngineeringManagers</a> who’s a few steps ahead of you. Managing performance is a skill like any other, and it’s way easier to handle when you’ve got someone (or at least a tiny kitten) in your corner.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="performance-management-is-a-leadership-problem">Performance Management Is a Leadership Problem</h2>
<p>If your top performer is quietly burning out while someone else is flailing with no direction, the problem isn’t them. It’s you.</p>
<center><img src="/mirror.jpg" width="300" alt="looking-in-the-mirror meme"></center>
<p>Performance management isn’t just about “fixing” low performers or tossing gold stars at your high ones. It’s about making sure everyone knows where they stand, what’s expected of them, and how they can grow. That takes real clarity, actual support, and the guts to have honest conversations, even when they’re awkward. <em>Especially</em> when they&rsquo;re awkward.</p>
<p>This is part of the job. You don’t get to opt out. If you’re avoiding it, I hate to break it to you but you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;leading.&rdquo; You’re &ldquo;hoping.&rdquo; And in the entire history of business, exactly zero good decisions have been made on hope.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up</h2>
<p>Performance management isn’t some checkbox you revisit in a mad dash to get all your reviews written on time once or twice a year. It’s the real, day-to-day work of leadership: helping people grow, course-correct, and do the best work of their careers. That means being honest. That means being consistent. And yeah, that&rsquo;s gonna mean having some uncomfortable conversations along the way.</p>
<p>But when you get it right? People thrive. Teams get stronger. And you stop spending your time putting out fires or wondering why your best folks are quietly disappearing.</p>
<p>So don’t put it off. Don’t hope it’ll sort itself out. Look at what your team needs and go do the thing.</p>

<center><small>Nothing feels better than a high-performing team firing on all cylinders.</small></center>

<p><strong>Hi, Hacker News!</strong> I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here! Getting front page&rsquo;d there was unexpected and cool. If you’re here from there, thanks for clicking. Hope you find something useful. Lots of good discussion in the comments there and I&rsquo;m planning some follow up posts Real Soon Now™ on some of the topics brought up (performance management, upward communication, etc.) so stay tuned!</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://scottkosman.com/post/blog/so-youre-a-manager-now-performance-management/">Part 2 of this series is now live</a>. It’s all about performance management: how to support the folks who are struggling, and the ones quietly crushing it.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the club. You either asked for this, or someone tapped you on the shoulder and said, “Hey, you seem responsible. Wanna be in charge of other humans?” Either way, here you are. Congrats. Or condolences. Maybe both.</p>
<p>Being a first-time manager is weird. You go from being great at your job to being a total beginner at a job that nobody really taught you how to do. There’s no “Manager Bootcamp.” There&rsquo;s no Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Engineering Management <em>(ok, actually, there is but they&rsquo;re scams. Just don&rsquo;t.)</em> You’re just… here now.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="your-job-isnt-to-do-the-work-anymore">Your Job Isn’t to Do the Work Anymore.</h2>
<p>I know. That part sucks a little. You were probably really good at your job. Now your job is to make sure other people can be good at <em>theirs</em>. You’re not the player, you’re the coach. Sometimes that means strategy and big-picture thinking. Sometimes it means shielding your team from dumb shit. Sometimes it means buying someone coffee and saying, “You’re not crazy. This <em>is</em> hard.”</p>
<p>You might miss the dopamine hit of pushing a PR or closing a ticket. That’s normal. It can be hard to feel useful when your output is meetings and docs instead of code and commits. But your job now is to build systems, not features. To coach, not to execute. To unblock and enable, not to do it all yourself.</p>
<p>This means you need to <em>trust your team</em> to get the work done instead of doing it yourself. Your instinct (especially under pressure) is going to be to fall back on the skills that got you this far in your career: to jump in, write the code, fix the bug, save the fuckin&rsquo; day. Occasionally a manager will need to dive in and do the ground-level work but that is the exception and not the rule because the reality is you have different <em>critical</em> responsibilities now.</p>
<p>Get comfortable with your impact being less visible but more meaningful.</p>
<center><img alt="What would you say... you do here?" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExanF2NHJiNXkxMGRjcWcyNXE1M2p1OG1sa3Zza3FlY2p5NWtqOXcybiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/ToMjGpJ1lQiQarAftaU/giphy.gif"></center>
<center><small>I've been doing management for over a decade and some days I still have no idea.</small></center>
<hr>
<h2 id="youre-going-to-mess-stuff-up-repeatedly">You’re Going To Mess Stuff Up. Repeatedly.</h2>
<p>You’ll give the wrong feedback. Or avoid a tough convo until it explodes. Or be too hands-on. Or not hands-on enough. It’s all part of it.</p>
<p>Nobody expects you to have all the answers. If you expect <em>yourself</em> to have all the answers you&rsquo;re setting yourself up for a heaping dose of reality check the very first time you run into a scenario you&rsquo;re unprepared for.</p>
<p>You’re not expected to be perfect. You <em>are</em> expected to notice when you screw up, own it, and get better. The goal isn’t “flawless.” It’s “fuck up better each time.”</p>
<p>Messing up is part of the job. What matters more is how you respond. Own your mistakes. Say the awkward thing out loud. Apologize when you blow it. Your team doesn’t need a flawless boss, they need a human one who’s willing to grow in public. That builds trust faster than pretending you’ve got it all figured out.</p>
<center><img alt="Be the Dude." src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNXFjaGp6YmRvdWE5anR4Nzl3dmZmdWx0cTFqN3hpN200ejg4eGMzNSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/bqalUGFYfyHzW/giphy.gif"></center>
<center><small>You're gonna fuck up. When you do... be The Dude.</small></center>
<hr>
<h2 id="be-clear-painfully-clear">Be Clear. Painfully Clear.</h2>
<p>You think you’re being obvious. You’re not. Spell out expectations. Over-communicate. Set goals in plain language. Be upfront when someone’s struggling, and just as vocal when they’re killing it. Being vague might feel &ldquo;nicer&rdquo; or &ldquo;more collaborative&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s actually just three cowardices in a trench coat.</p>
<p>Clarity is one of the most underrated tools you have. Without it, people spin. They waste time guessing what “done” means, or whether their work matters, or if you’re secretly disappointed in them. Your job is to remove that ambiguity. Define what good looks like. Repeat yourself. Make sure people feel safe asking you to repeat it again.</p>
<p>As a manager one of the most important tasks you have on any given day is this: <strong>provide context</strong>. The people on your team need to have a strong understanding of why their work matters, why what they&rsquo;re doing is important, and how they&rsquo;re measuring up to expectations. If an engineer feels like they&rsquo;re doing pointless busy work that&rsquo;s a sign that <strong>you</strong> haven&rsquo;t done your job correctly.</p>
<p>Nobody ever said, “Gee, I wish my manager had been <em>less</em> clear with me.”</p>

<h3 id="got-a-good-boss-follow-their-lead">Got a Good Boss? Follow Their Lead.</h3>
<p>If you lucked into a solid leader above you, you’ve hit the jackpot. Learn from them. <em>Learn from their mistakes</em> (because they will make them). Ask questions. Ask questions about their mistakes! Let them sanity-check your 1:1s or feedback drafts. Tell them when you’re in over your head. Good leaders <em>want</em> to help you level up.</p>
<p>Also? When you have a rough day, they’ll know exactly why it sucks. That alone is gold.</p>
<h3 id="got-a-not-so-good-boss-dont-let-them-turn-you-into-one-too">Got a Not-So-Good Boss? Don’t Let Them Turn You Into One Too.</h3>
<p>If your leader is checked out, incompetent, or toxic, sorry. That’s rough. But don’t let their bad habits shape yours.</p>
<p>Be the kind of manager <em>you</em> wish you had. Find support elsewhere: peers, mentors, communities, even ex-managers you trusted. Set your own standard. And yeah, keep receipts. Just in case.</p>
<p>Bad leadership above you isn’t an excuse to stop giving a shit.</p>

<h2 id="protect-your-energy">Protect Your Energy.</h2>
<p>Management is emotionally expensive. You’ll absorb team stress, cross-functional chaos, and your own endless self-doubt. That’s the gig. Your calendar fills up fast, and those blocks aren&rsquo;t just &ldquo;meetings,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re your priorities on full display.</p>
<p>You <em>have</em> to take care of yourself. Whatever that looks like: therapy, journaling, going for a silly little walk, blocking off calendar time to think instead of react. Do that. Often.</p>
<p>Something important to keep in mind here: burnout doesn’t always show up as dramatic exhaustion. Sometimes it sneaks in quiet. You stop caring. You feel numb. You start defaulting to “whatever.” That’s burnout too. Watch for it in yourself <em>and</em> in your team. If you burn out, <strong>your team burns with you.</strong> I&rsquo;ve been on good teams that have crumbled when their manager crashed. <em>I&rsquo;ve been that manager.</em> It sucks.</p>

<p>When you were an IC, you probably did some incredible work. Shipped cool features. Fixed nightmare bugs at 2 a.m. Made things people loved. You got the praise, maybe even a shiny award or two. That was nice. Hate to break it to you but those days are over.</p>
<p>Good managers don&rsquo;t get trophies because we&rsquo;re no longer Doing The Things, we&rsquo;re <em>Empowering</em> The Things. There&rsquo;s a reason an Engineering Manager has never won a Webby award.</p>
<p>At my day job we use a platform called <a href="https://bonusly.com/">Bonusly</a> for people to give little shout-outs (shouts-out?) to their peers for doing something awesome. I rarely get any awards here, but people on my teams get them all the damn time and to me that speaks incredible volumes. When I see someone from another team thank one of my ICs for their help or recognizing something they&rsquo;ve done <em>that&rsquo;s a checkmark in my win column too</em> because I&rsquo;m empowering that. I&rsquo;m creating an environment where this happens on the regular.</p>

<p>You’re not going to get it all right. None of us do. But if you show up with humility, curiosity, and a genuine desire to make work suck less for the people around you? That’s real leadership.</p>
<p>You’ve got this. And even on the days you feel like you don’t, that’s okay too. Welcome to the deep end.</p>

Here's what I wish someone had done for me and how I'm doing it differently for the next generation.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I became a manager by accident.</p>
<p>Not in the &ldquo;oops, I left my desk and came back to a team&rdquo; kind of way, but close. I was a strong IC. I wrote good code, made solid architectural decisions, hit my deadlines, and collaborated well with others. I published articles. I taught university classes in three countries. I won awards: I have multiple Cannes Golden Lions and I <em>definitely</em> built websites you&rsquo;ve used, apps you&rsquo;ve downloaded, and TV commercials you&rsquo;ve watched.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve shipped work for some of the biggest, most recognisable brands in the world. If I checked your closet, your garage, your fridge, and your desk I&rsquo;d almost certainly find logos of companies I&rsquo;ve worked for. I&rsquo;ve had my work prominently displayed in galleries, on billboards, even featured at events in the White House. I was <em>at the fucking top of my industry.</em> And then it all fell apart.</p>
<p>What happened? Someone looked at all that and said to themselfs &ldquo;we should hire this guy and make him a Director!&rdquo; Next thing I knew they threw a lot of money at me and suddenly I was running a team. This team was entirely comprised of people smarter than me.</p>
<p>And I had no idea what I was doing.</p>

<p>That first year in leadership was rough. I spent a lot of time pretending I had answers I didn&rsquo;t have, staying up late reading management books I barely understood, and sweating spinal fluid trying to project the impression that I wasn&rsquo;t fifty-eleven leagues out of my depth.</p>
<p>No one really trained me. I was just suddenly &ldquo;in charge.&rdquo; The assumption seemed to be: <em>if you&rsquo;re good at the job, you&rsquo;ll know how to lead others doing it.</em></p>
<center><img alt="That's not how any of this works!" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaHBlaXZuMno4aWI4dzloMzdvZnM4czBrYjYwNWd4a2ZxYXpjZXl1ZSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/r5SxJYcU21Auk/giphy.gif"></center>
<center><small>Hiring the right people is <strong>really hard</strong> as it turns out.</small></center>

<h2 id="what-i-wish-id-had">What I Wish I&rsquo;d Had</h2>
<p>Looking back, I don&rsquo;t blame the people who hired me. They were doing their best with what they knew, apparently I talked a good game in the interview, and I went in bright-eyed and bushy tailed trying to do my best to not turn everything around me into a smouldering crater.</p>
<p>I had enthusiasm and ambition but what I <em>really</em> needed was <strong>training</strong>. Mentorship. Space to observe and absorb. Time to develop my own point of view.</p>
<p>I needed someone to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what changes when you become a manager.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what support looks like now.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what to expect when someone you like starts struggling.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how to give hard feedback without losing the room.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I needed someone to walk alongside me while I learned how to lead, and now that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to do differently.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-doing-differently">What I&rsquo;m Doing Differently</h2>
<p>At my day job we have a role called <em>Team Lead</em> which is essentially a junior Engineering Manager. One of my senior engineers stepped into it recently. They&rsquo;re curious about management, so instead of tossing them into the deep end, we&rsquo;re slow-playing it.</p>
<p>They get to work under an experienced manager <strike>who never makes mistakes</strike> and learn from their mistakes while slowly getting introduced to Manager Lifestyle™.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving them exposure to 1:1s <em>before</em> asking them to lead one solo</li>
<li>Letting them shadow performance reviews, then co-write the next one</li>
<li>Talking openly about the emotional weight of leadership — the invisible stuff</li>
<li>Giving space to screw up in low-risk scenarios</li>
<li>Building feedback muscles gradually instead of waiting for a &ldquo;big moment&rdquo;</li>
<li>And most critically important of all: letting <em>them</em> see <em>me</em> screw up</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t to delay their growth. It&rsquo;s to scaffold it.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-for-the-new-managers-in-the-audience">A Note For The New Managers In The Audience</h2>
<p>Are you a new manager or thinking of becoming one? Here. Come here. Have a seat.</p>
<center><small><img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTZjMDliOTUyczNja3E5Y2FjbnBpYzZnZWVsajZvZG92NXR1ZzRtMHN4aXZzdDc5MiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/3xqh9FxO2PpiU/giphy.gif"></small></center>
<p>The scariest part of moving from an IC to Management role is that you suddenly start leaving behind the skills that have made you successful. Your programming skills start moving out of the picture as more of your time becomes invested in people and process.</p>
<p>React can do a lot of things, but it can&rsquo;t help you coach a low-performing engineer out of the weeds. It can&rsquo;t do the work of collaborating with your Product team to plan out next year&rsquo;s roadmap and staffing plan. That&rsquo;s on you and as a new manager you need to learn to flex entirely different muscles you didn&rsquo;t even know you had.</p>
<p>Leadership is a skillset. It&rsquo;s not unlocked with a job title. And it <em>can</em> be taught and it <em>can</em> be learned but only if everyone involved is intentional about how we bring people into it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some words coming for you soon enough, hang tight.</p>

<h2 id="training-the-next-manager-starts-with-their-current-one-thats-you">Training the Next Manager Starts With Their Current One (That&rsquo;s You)</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a position of leadership and you see someone on your team with potential, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you preparing them for the job, or just handing it to them?</li>
<li>Are you giving them feedback, or just responsibility?</li>
<li>Are you normalizing the messiness of leadership, or pretending it&rsquo;s all intuitive?</li>
</ul>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need more accidental managers. We need leaders who were taught, supported, and encouraged to lead with clarity and care.</p>
<p>That starts with us.</p>
