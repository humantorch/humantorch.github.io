&lt;p>Not always in that order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m Scott. I lead project teams building websites, applications, and other computery-type things that you can click/tap/touch/swipe/wave at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was the heady days of 2001. The dot-com bubble had burst, economies were in the soup, consumer dollars were nowhere to be seen, and it seemed like a really dumb time to get involved in the creative/advertising world of computers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Scott</title><link>https://scottkosman.com/post/readme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 20:18:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://scottkosman.com/post/readme/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="whats-all-this-then">What’s All This Then?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is my version of a &amp;ldquo;Manager README.&amp;rdquo; The purpose is to introduce myself and give you insight into how I think, how I work, and to answer some questions you might have about me. This is a living document and will change over time as necessary. Keeping it transparent is intentional.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tldr">TL;DR&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I care deeply about &lt;strong>people&lt;/strong>, then &lt;strong>product&lt;/strong>, then &lt;strong>process&lt;/strong>, in that order.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I value &lt;strong>transparency&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>context&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>feedback&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I don’t micromanage and expect you to &lt;strong>own your work&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll always know where you stand with me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I’m available via Slack and rarely answer phone calls unless it’s urgent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is a &lt;strong>living document&lt;/strong> and may evolve over time.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-this-is-not">What This Is Not&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>❌ It won’t list my expectations of you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>❌ It won’t tell you how to do your job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>❌ It won’t define how any particular project should be run.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="important-note">Important Note&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This README is unofficial and does &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> override any formal HR policies or performance management processes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
