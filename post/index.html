A GREY, DRIZZLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. 7:48 AM PACIFIC TIME. INTERIOR OF A RED PONTIAC SUNFIRE. DATE: MARCH 15, 2006 A young man decides that, on his way to work this morning, a cup of coffee and perhaps a delicious pastry of some sort would certainly not go amiss. It just so happens that his place of work is within rock-throwing distance of no fewer than seven Starbucks locations. He chooses his preferred one; the lineups are usually longer there, but he enjoys the friendliness of the staff. Besides, showing up at work on time this morning isn’t really a priority.

Not in the “oops, I left my desk and came back to a team” kind of way, but close. I was a strong IC. I wrote good code, made solid architectural decisions, hit my deadlines, and collaborated well with others. I published articles. I taught university classes in three countries. I won awards: I have multiple Cannes Golden Lions and I definitely built websites you’ve used, apps you’ve downloaded, and TV commercials you’ve watched.

With [gestures vaguely] everything going on around us, it’s never been more important to draw clear lines in the sand. You have to know where you’re flexible, and where compromise simply isn’t an option.
As a manager — someone responsible for the care and feeding of nearly twenty humans — this feels even more critical. Leadership is hard. The pressure is constant, the stakes are high, and the demands come from all directions. But here’s what I’ve learned: if you don’t define the values and boundaries you absolutely won’t bend, your leadership will be reactionary at best, and at worst, just damage control. Without clear non-negotiables, you risk losing yourself, your team’s trust, and ultimately, the ability to lead with integrity. This post is about owning those lines in the sand, early and deliberately, so you can lead with clarity and confidence, even when the pressure hits.

Not always in that order.
Hi.
I’m Scott. I lead project teams building websites, applications, and other computery-type things that you can click/tap/touch/swipe/wave at.
It was the heady days of 2001. The dot-com bubble had burst, economies were in the soup, consumer dollars were nowhere to be seen, and it seemed like a really dumb time to get involved in the creative/advertising world of computers.

This is my version of a “Manager README.” The purpose is to introduce myself and give you insight into how I think, how I work, and to answer some questions you might have about me. This is a living document and will change over time as necessary. Keeping it transparent is intentional.
TL;DR I care deeply about people, then product, then process, in that order. I value transparency, context, and feedback. I don’t micromanage and expect you to own your work. You’ll always know where you stand with me. I’m available via Slack and rarely answer phone calls unless it’s urgent. This is a living document and may evolve over time. What This Is Not ❌ It won’t list my expectations of you. ❌ It won’t tell you how to do your job. ❌ It won’t define how any particular project should be run. Important Note This README is unofficial and does not override any formal HR policies or performance management processes.
