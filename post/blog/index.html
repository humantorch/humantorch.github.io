You either asked for this, or someone tapped you on the shoulder and said, “Hey, you seem responsible. Wanna be in charge of other humans?” Either way, here you are. Congrats. Or condolences. Maybe both.
Being a first-time manager is weird. You go from being great at your job to being a total beginner at a job that nobody really taught you how to do. There’s no “Manager Bootcamp.” There’s no Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering Management (ok, actually, there is but they’re scams. Just don’t.) You’re just… here now.</p></div><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to So You're A Manager Now." href=https://scottkosman.com/post/blog/so-youre-a-manager-now/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent><a href=/post/blog/the-day-the-sugar-didnt-make-it/>The Day The Sugar Didn't Make It</a></h2></header><div class=entry-content><time>July 3, 2025</time><p>SCENE: SEATTLE. A GREY, DRIZZLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. 7:48 AM PACIFIC TIME. INTERIOR OF A RED PONTIAC SUNFIRE. DATE: MARCH 15, 2006 A young man decides that, on his way to work this morning, a cup of coffee and perhaps a delicious pastry of some sort would certainly not go amiss. It just so happens that his place of work is within rock-throwing distance of no fewer than seven Starbucks locations. He chooses his preferred one; the lineups are usually longer there, but he enjoys the friendliness of the staff. Besides, showing up at work on time this morning isn’t really a priority.</p></div><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Day The Sugar Didn't Make It" href=https://scottkosman.com/post/blog/the-day-the-sugar-didnt-make-it/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent><a href=/post/blog/how-to-train-your-manager/>How to Train Your D̶r̶a̶g̶o̶n̶ Manager</a></h2></header><div class=entry-content><time>June 23, 2025</time><p>I became a manager by accident.
Not in the “oops, I left my desk and came back to a team” kind of way, but close. I was a strong IC. I wrote good code, made solid architectural decisions, hit my deadlines, and collaborated well with others. I published articles. I taught university classes in three countries. I won awards: I have multiple Cannes Golden Lions and I definitely built websites you’ve used, apps you’ve downloaded, and TV commercials you’ve watched.</p></div><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to How to Train Your D̶r̶a̶g̶o̶n̶ Manager" href=https://scottkosman.com/post/blog/how-to-train-your-manager/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent><a href=/post/blog/leading-without-non-negotiables/>Leading Without Non-Negotiables Is Just Damage Control</a></h2></header><div class=entry-content><time>June 22, 2025</time><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about non-negotiables lately in both my personal and professional life. With [gestures vaguely] everything going on around us, it’s never been more important to draw clear lines in the sand. You have to know where you’re flexible, and where compromise simply isn’t an option.
As a manager — someone responsible for the care and feeding of nearly twenty humans — this feels even more critical. Leadership is hard. The pressure is constant, the stakes are high, and the demands come from all directions. But here’s what I’ve learned: if you don’t define the values and boundaries you absolutely won’t bend, your leadership will be reactionary at best, and at worst, just damage control. Without clear non-negotiables, you risk losing yourself, your team’s trust, and ultimately, the ability to lead with integrity. This post is about owning those lines in the sand, early and deliberately, so you can lead with clarity and confidence, even when the pressure hits.</p></div><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Leading Without Non-Negotiables Is Just Damage Control" href=https://scottkosman.com/post/blog/leading-without-non-negotiables/></a></article></section></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://scottkosman.com/>scott kosman</a></span> ·
