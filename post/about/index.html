Hi.
I’m Scott. I lead project teams building websites, applications, and other computery-type things that you can click/tap/touch/swipe/wave at.
It was the heady days of 2001. The dot-com bubble had burst, economies were in the soup, consumer dollars were nowhere to be seen, and it seemed like a really dumb time to get involved in the creative/advertising world of computers."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://humantorch.github.io/post/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.ae8ee2603f6495378f6621d5666cb656b6a0d4535f1ad9255443952ef2774be1.css integrity="sha256-ro7iYD9klTePZiHVZmy2Vrag1FNfGtklVEOVLvJ3S+E=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.f413e19d0714851f6474e7ee9632408e58ac146fbdbe62747134bea2fa3415e0.js integrity="sha256-9BPhnQcUhR9kdOfuljJAjlisFG+9vmJ0cTS+ovo0FeA=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://humantorch.github.io/favicon/favicon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://humantorch.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://humantorch.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://humantorch.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://humantorch.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta name=twitter:card content="card goes here"><meta name=twitter:site content="@humantorch"><meta name=twitter:title content="scott kosman"><meta name=twitter:description content=" Engineering leader open to EM/Sr. EM roles in the GTA or remote worldwide!"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://humantorch.github.io/scott-2.jpg"><meta property="og:title" content="About"><meta property="og:description" content="Bicycle rider.
