# humantorch.github.io

https://scottkosman.com is set up using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) on GitHub Pages, then piping it to a custom domain name.

This was a super quick, fast, and free* way to get a basic personal site up and running over the course of a single evening.

Maybe someday I'll write out a longer description of the process but basically I followed [this guide](https://youngkin.github.io/post/createafreeblogsite/), only I switched Hugo to use .yaml for the config file rather than the default .toml format mostly because I personally find .yaml files easier to read. I'm also using the excellent [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme.

_* free except for the cost of owning the domain name, I've had this one since about 2003 so might as well keep using it_
