&lt;p>Not always in that order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Iâ€™m Scott. I lead project teams building websites, applications, and other computery-type things that you can click/tap/touch/swipe/wave at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was the heady days of 2001. The dot-com bubble had burst, economies were in the soup, consumer dollars were nowhere to be seen, and it seemed like a really dumb time to get involved in the creative/advertising world of computers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Scott</title><link>https://humantorch.github.io/post/readme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 20:18:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://humantorch.github.io/post/readme/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="whats-all-this-then">What&amp;rsquo;s all this then?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is my version of a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://managerreadme.com">manager README&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; The point of this README is to introduce myself and give you an idea of how I think, how I work and answer some questions you might have about me. This is a living document so it &lt;strike>may&lt;/strike> will change over time as necessary. Keeping this in the open is intentional.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-this-not">What is this not?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>This is not going to lay out my expectations of you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is not going to say how I think any particular project should be run.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is not going to tell you how to do your job.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="important-note">Important note&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is &lt;em>unofficial&lt;/em> in regards to any standard HR practices. Nothing in this document supersedes or replaces any standard performance-management tools or processes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
