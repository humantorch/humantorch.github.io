Hi.
Iâ€™m Scott. I lead project teams building websites, applications, and other computery-type things that you can click/tap/touch/swipe/wave at.
It was the heady days of 2001. The dot-com bubble had burst, economies were in the soup, consumer dollars were nowhere to be seen, and it seemed like a really dumb time to get involved in the creative/advertising world of computers.</description></item><item><title>How To Scott</title><link>https://humantorch.github.io/post/readme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 20:18:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://humantorch.github.io/post/readme/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s all this then? This is my version of a &amp;ldquo;manager README.&amp;rdquo; The point of this README is to introduce myself and give you an idea of how I think, how I work and answer some questions you might have about me. This is a living document so it may will change over time as necessary. Keeping this in the open is intentional.
What is this not? This is not going to lay out my expectations of you This is not going to say how I think any particular project should be run.</description></item></channel></rss>
